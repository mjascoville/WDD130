    <h1>Eraserhead grunge; a picture of home</h1>
    <img src="images/warehouse.jpg" alt="warehouse">
    <p>This is a picture of an industrial warehouse that makes me think of two things. First, the classic movie by David Lynch, Eraserhead. Secondly, a normal sight that you'd find in Pittsburgh, PA. This is where I grew up, and I loved exploring places like this. There were a lot of abandoned steel mills near my house, and we spent a lot of time in our youth wandering around them.</p>
