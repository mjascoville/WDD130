        Welcome to the wonderful world of dorodangos! This site is my humble contribution to the preservation of the art of dorodangos. What is a dorodango, you might ask? Well, you've come to the right place to learn about them! This site will explain the "what" and the "why" of dorodangos (navigate to History above for more information), and will also go into the process of creating these wonderful orbs of earth. Below is a small gallery of my own work, and if you are at all intrigued, you have already taken your first step down the journey of creating your own dorodangos!

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        Dorodango is a traditional Japanese art form that involves transforming ordinary mud into polished spherical objects. The word "dorodango" can be translated to mean "mud dumpling" or "mud ball." The history of dorodangos is not well-documented, but it is believed to have originated in Japan many centuries ago. The exact origins of dorodango are unclear, as the art form was likely passed down through generations by word of mouth rather than being formally recorded. It is believed to have started as a pastime for children, who would create simple mud balls and then polish them to a glossy finish. Over time, dorodango evolved into a more refined and deliberate art form. It began to gain recognition as a traditional craft in Japan during the 20th century, and its popularity has since spread to other parts of the world. Dorodangos are often admired for their simplicity and beauty. They come in various sizes and colors, depending on the type of soil or clay used in their creation. In recent years, dorodangos have gained attention as a form of meditative art, with people around the world experimenting with different techniques and materials to create their own unique mud balls. Personally, I find it to be a very inspiring and engaging art form. You are able to take something totally ordinary, like the soil around you, and turn it into something beautiful.

      </ul>
      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p>
        To make a dorodango, you begin by obtaining some clay to work with. You can find clay almost anywhere in the world, simply in the soil around you. In order to process soil into clay, you must take an amount of soil and dilute it with water. At this point, you must pour the water into another container and wait for the clay to settle to the bottom. Once you have this wet clay, you can leave it out to dry, and you will have some material to work with. Shape the clay into a rough sphere by compressing and rolling it in your hands, ensuring there are no air bubbles and creating a solid core. Apply increasingly finer layers of soil or clay onto the mud ball, allowing each layer to dry before adding the next one. Smooth and polish the surface of the dorodango between each layer, using a soft cloth or a smooth object like a stone, until a smooth and glossy finish is achieved. Repeat this process of layering and polishing, exercising patience as it may take several hours, until the desired sheen and glass-like appearance are obtained. Through careful layering and meticulous polishing, you can create your own unique and polished dorodango. I find that the easiest way to polish your dorodango is with a glass jar. You can roll the sphere on the rim of the glass jar to easily polish the exterior. The process of making a dorodango goes beyond the physical act of shaping and polishing mud. It is a meditative and contemplative practice that requires focus and patience. As you engage with the mud, you become attuned to its texture, moisture, and malleability, creating a deeper connection with the natural materials. The repetitive motions of compressing, rolling, and polishing become a form of mindful movement, allowing you to enter a state of calm and concentration. Through this artistic process, you not only create a visually stunning dorodango but also experience a sense of tranquility and harmony with the elements. The beauty of dorodangos lies not only in their final form but also in the journey of creation and the profound connection to the earth it fosters.
