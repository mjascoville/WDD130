        <p class="paragraph1">To make a dorodango, you begin by obtaining some clay to work with. You can find clay almost anywhere in the world, simply in the soil around you. In order to process soil into clay, you must take an amount of soil and dilute it with water. At this point, you must pour the water into another container and wait for the clay to settle to the bottom. Once you have this wet clay, you can leave it out to dry, and you will have some material to work with. Shape the clay into a rough sphere by compressing and rolling it in your hands, ensuring there are no air bubbles and creating a solid core. Apply increasingly finer layers of soil or clay onto the mud ball, allowing each layer to dry before adding the next one. Smooth and polish the surface of the dorodango between each layer, using a soft cloth or a smooth object like a stone, until a smooth and glossy finish is achieved.</p>
        <p class="paragraph2">Repeat this process of layering and polishing, exercising patience as it may take several hours, until the desired sheen and glass-like appearance are obtained. Through careful layering and meticulous polishing, you can create your own unique and polished dorodango. I find that the easiest way to polish your dorodango is with a glass jar. You can roll the sphere on the rim of the glass jar to easily polish the exterior. The process of making a dorodango goes beyond the physical act of shaping and polishing mud. It is a meditative and contemplative practice that requires focus and patience. As you engage with the mud, you become attuned to its texture, moisture, and malleability, creating a deeper connection with the natural materials. The repetitive motions of compressing, rolling, and polishing become a form of mindful movement, allowing you to enter a state of calm and concentration. Through this artistic process, you not only create a visually stunning dorodango but also experience a sense of tranquility and harmony with the elements. The beauty of dorodangos lies not only in their final form but also in the journey of creation and the profound connection to the earth it fosters.</p>
